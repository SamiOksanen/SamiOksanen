### About

Iâ€™m a responsible employee who is really passionate about programming and most importantly a really nice guy with a great team working skills. You will see after reviewing my portfolio that I possess astute programming skills. If you or someone you know has some opportunity to offer, let me know.

My passion is always to be creative. I love to see things that I have made - things that I can be proud of.
